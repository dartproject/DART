            [esc_comment] => (Q4: 5/16/11) Riley seems to truly enjoy reading, but he hasn't been as interested toward the end of this quarter. Any reading that can be done at home over the summer may bring him back around in time for Kindergarten. HS

(Q3: 3/8/11) Riley loves to read and enjoys asking questions about everything he sees. He notices the details in the pictures and the writing. HS

05/17/10  Q4  Riley enjoys stories tremendously.  He gives a lot of attention to the illustrations in books and can put his finger on the words when it is being read.  NC

03/02/10  Q3  Riley recognizes his first name in print.  He is able to recognize the letters in his first name in other words and in other places in our classroom.  He is beginning to associate certain letters with other children in our room (for example, H is for Heather).  He is improving greatly as a member of an audience and has become more engaged with stories read to him and the class.  NC

01/10/10  Q2  Riley enjoys reading both independently and with a group.  He can recognize his first name in print most of the time.  NC
